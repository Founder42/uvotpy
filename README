Swift UVOT grism spectral extraction code
*******************************************

The UVOTPY code provides software to extract wavelength 
and flux calibrated spectra from Swift Ultraviolet and 
Optical Grism images. The software has been tested on 
Mac and Linux.

The Swift UVOT grism calibration has been described in 
 http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02433

For detailed documentation, visit the grism calibration 
website available from: 

   http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/www_astro/uvot/ 

In the current release of the software, the grism 
calibration files are included in the package, but 
require the definition of en environment variable, 

setenv UVOTPY <installation directory>

so that $UVOTPY/calfiles/ which contains the calibration 
files can be found by the software.
