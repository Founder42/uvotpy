Swift UVOT grism spectral extraction code
*******************************************

The UVOTPY code provides software to extract wavelength 
and flux calibrated spectra from Swift Ultraviolet and 
Optical Grism images. The software has been tested on 
Mac and Linux.

For detailed documentation, visit the grism calibration 
website available from: 

   http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/www_astro/uvot/ 

In the initial release of the software, the grism 
calibration files are included in the package, but 
require the definition of en environment variable, 

setenv UVOTPY <installation directory>

so that $UVOTPY/calfiles/ contains the calibration files.
